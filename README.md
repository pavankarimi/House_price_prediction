# 🏡 House Price Prediction
  A dope web app that predicts housing prices using a trained Machine Learning model — just drop in house features and let it spit out a prediction. Built with  Python + ML backend and deployed on Render.

  🔥 Enter house details and get predicted prices in real time!

# 🧠 Project Overview
 This project trains a model to predict house prices from key property features. The model learns patterns based on historical data and then gives you price estimates based on user-provided inputs.

# 🧪 Typical workflow:
 - Data Prep & EDA
 - Feature Engineering
 - Train ML regression model
 -  Deploy as a web app

# 💡 Features
  - Predict house price from user inputs
  - Fast inference with pre-trained ML model
  - Clean UI for entering features
  - Useful for real-estate insights

# 🛠️ Built With
  - Python
  - Scikit-Learn (ML Model Training)
  - Flask or FastAPI (Backend API)
  - HTML/CSS/JS (Frontend)
  - Render (Deployment)

# 📈 How It Works
 - You enter house parameters (e.g., size, rooms, location, etc.).
 - Frontend sends values to backend API.
 - The ML model loads and predicts the house price.
 - The result gets shown back on the UI.
